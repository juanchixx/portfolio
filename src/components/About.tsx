                <p>
                  With over 5 years of experience in frontend development and UX/UI design, 
                  I specialize in transforming complex ideas into intuitive, performant web applications. 
                  My journey began with a fascination for how design and technology intersect to solve real-world problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I believe that great software is not just about clean codeâ€”it's about understanding user needs, 
                  anticipating their challenges, and crafting solutions that feel natural and delightful to use. 
                  This philosophy drives every project I work on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new design trends, contributing to open-source projects, 
                  or mentoring junior developers in the community.
